# Healthcare-Time-Series-Forecasting
# 🏥 Patient Volume Forecasting – Healthcare Analytics

## 📌 Overview
Hospitals rely heavily on accurate patient volume forecasts to optimize staffing, bed allocation, and operational efficiency.  
This project builds an end-to-end time series forecasting solution to predict daily patient visits using historical hospital data.

The project simulates realistic hospital visit patterns over two years and applies multiple forecasting models to compare performance and accuracy.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem
Unpredictable patient arrivals can lead to:
- Staff shortages or overstaffing
- Increased patient waiting times
- Inefficient use of hospital resources

This project aims to support hospital decision-makers with data-driven patient volume forecasts.
